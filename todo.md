# Kanban – Yes, This is kanban

## Ideas

- Transaction system for scrapers to allow for regular refresh of total links

## In Planning

- Authorization System (Controller, Scraper, Client)
- Authentication System: Most likely JWT or API token
- Graph (Formalization has to be done for at least the algorithm)
    - Transitive algorithm
    - Provide fallback for some open-plattforms (e.g., medium.com)

## In Progress

- General OpenAPI Specifications
- DB Layout
- Basic spec compliant API

## Done Implementing

- None … Yeah that's how experiemental this project is.
